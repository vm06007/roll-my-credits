# Roll My Credits 🎬🔐

A steganography application for hiding cryptocurrency seed phrases in movie posters and credit sequences. Created for ETHGlobal Cannes hackathon.

## Overview

Roll My Credits combines traditional steganography techniques with deep learning to securely hide sensitive information (like crypto wallet recovery phrases) in media files. The project offers multiple encoding methods, from simple image manipulation to advanced neural network-based approaches.

## Features

- **Image Steganography**: Hide text in movie posters using traditional LSB or AI-based methods
- **Video Steganography**: Embed messages in movie credit sequences frame-by-frame
- **Custom BIP39 Resolver**: Map movie-themed words to standard crypto recovery phrases
- **Multiple Techniques**: Choose between traditional or deep learning approaches
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React-based web app with intuitive encode/decode workflows
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ethereum smart contract for decentralized word mapping

## Visual Overview

### Steganography Theory

Understanding how information can be hidden in plain sight:

![Basic Steganography Concept](theory/basic-stego.webp)

*Basic steganography methodology - hiding data within digital media*

### Real-World Use Cases

Our steganography techniques can be applied to various scenarios where discrete information sharing is essential:

#### Digital Privacy & Security

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.18.1+
- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg installed
- Git

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd react-boilerplate
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Deep Learning Service (Optional)

```bash
cd deepstego
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

The AI service will run on `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

### Encoding a Seed Phrase

1. Navigate to the web interface
2. Select "Encode" mode
3. Choose between poster or video encoding
4. Upload your media file or select from examples
5. Enter your seed phrase or secret message
6. Select encoding method (traditional or AI)
7. Download the encoded file

### Decoding a Message

1. Select "Decode" mode
2. Upload the encoded media file
3. Choose the corresponding decoding method
4. View the extracted message

### Custom BIP39 Words

The smart contract allows mapping custom movie-themed words to standard BIP39 words:
- Deploy the contract to your preferred network
- Use the web interface to configure custom mappings
- Enhanced memorability with themed recovery phrases

## API Endpoints

### Backend API

- `POST /api/steganography/encode-image` - Hide text in image
- `POST /api/steganography/decode-image` - Extract text from image
- `POST /api/steganography/encode-video` - Hide text in video
- `POST /api/steganography/decode-video` - Extract text from video

### Deep Learning API

- `POST /hide` - AI-based text hiding
- `POST /reveal` - AI-based text extraction

## Security Considerations

- Messages are processed locally - no data is stored permanently
- Use strong passphrases for additional encryption
- Verify decoded messages match originals
- Consider using multiple encoding layers for critical data
- Always maintain secure backups of seed phrases
